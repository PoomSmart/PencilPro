# PencilPro
Apple Pencil can do better, but more like for Apple Pencil 2?

## What it can
- Auto-pairs your Pencil as you snap your Pencil at the edge of iPad Pro
- Allows some of the finger-only gestures to be invoked using Pencil - invoking Control Center and Notifcations, for example

## What it can't, yet
- Overrides the application to launch when using Pencil to wake an iPad by double-tapping it (Instant Notes feature)
- Allows revealing Dock and switching between application using Pencil
- Things that are not mentioned in the previous section
