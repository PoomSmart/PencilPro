# PencilPro
Apple Pencil can do better, but more like for Apple Pencil 2?

## What it can
- Auto-pairs your Pencil as you snap your Pencil at the edge of iPad Pro
- Allows some of the finger-only gestures to be invoked using Pencil - invoking Control Center and Notifications, for example

## What it can (with help from Accessibility, credits @crapasanya)
- Go to Settings > Accessibility > Zoom and turn on Zoom
- Double-tap three fingers to zoom out
- Use your pencil to invoke Dock

## What it can't, yet
- Overrides the application to launch when using Pencil to wake an iPad by double-tapping it (Instant Notes feature)
- Things that are not mentioned in the previous section
